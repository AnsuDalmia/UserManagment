# UserManagment
The User Management Application is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for managing user
data. It allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user records. The
application is built using modern web technologies such as React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It
follows a client-server architecture where the client-side is developed using React and the server-side
is built with Node.js and Express.
